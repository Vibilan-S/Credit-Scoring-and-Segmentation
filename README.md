## ⚙️ Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vibilan-S/Credit-Scoring-and-Segmentation.git
cd Credit-Scoring-and-Segmentation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage
Run the main notebook or script:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

## 📊 Results
- **Credit Scoring Model Accuracy:** 87% (Logistic Regression)
- **Segmentation:** 4 customer clusters identified using K-Means
- **Key Insights:**
  - Cluster 1: High credit score, low risk
  - Cluster 2: Medium credit score, moderate risk
  - Cluster 3: Low credit score, high risk
  - Cluster 4: New customers with insufficient data
